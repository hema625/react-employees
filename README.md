## 
Have created an app for employees using `PERN`(Postgre,Express,React and Node) stack.
This app displays the employee information from the database.(postgre was installed on my machine. so didnt use the online database)
All `CRUD operations` are implemented.
Have displayed the details of the employees using `React Table`(as mentioned).
Users can filter a particular field using the textbox provided for filtering.
Have used Bootstrap for styling the pages.
There is a `Landing page` for the app.
All `API end points` are taken care.
User can read,add,edit/update or delete an employee using the links and buttons provided for the same.
`Signup and login` are added for future enhancement(which can be implemented using passport.js)

Thank you for providing an opportunity to complete this exercise. Can you please provide feedback for the same.
